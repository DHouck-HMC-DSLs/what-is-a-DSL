# Assignment HOWTO

The Assignment HOWTO article appears to be a 404 page, because the github.io
repository for hmc-cs111-fall2015/ appears to be nonexistant. Therefore, I was
unable to complete that part of the assignment. Instead, I asked other class
members for summaries of the page (because it appears to have existed before I
tried to get to it), and they told me that the the basic summary was
“How to GitHub”. Specifically, fork the repository, modify the files, and submit
a pull request. This is what I have done.

# Choice of DSL

I wrote about [ACSL](http://frama-c.com/acsl.html) because it is one I am
interested in and I thought other class members would not have heard of it. I
considered instead writing about [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/). While writing
about ACSL, I realized that some of the questions weren’t really targetted at
DSLs which were not designed for programming in. I had trouble, for example,
describing the computational model of ACSL when it doesn’t exactly perform
computation and you don’t execute programs written in it. However, I believe it
should still count as a DSL for the same reason that Markdown does, and I would
have had equal trouble describing Markdown’s computational model.

If for some reason I misunderstood the extent of the assignment and I was
supposed to write about a more computational DSL, I will be happy to write
another report on tup.

# Running CFDG

I couldn’t find a GUI; I think that may only be available for Windows. Thus, I
ran it from the command line instead of using the Render menu.

# PNG File name

The writeup says the variant number should be three letters. Maybe I’m looking
in the wrong place, but the variant numbers I saw were six letters. This may be
related to my using the command line.
